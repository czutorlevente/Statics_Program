# Overview

I wrote a software that is able to solve a typical statical calculation about the support reactions of pillars of a bridge beased on the loads it has. 

I wrote this because it can help me in another class, Statics and Strengths of Materials.

# Development Environment

I used previous projects of mine to reming myself of some of the syntax, and asked chat GPT a lot too. 

The programming language was C#, and I only usecd the system library, which included everything that I needed for this project.

# Future Work

- For my next assignment I want to create code that will draw diagrams for these calculations (like moment and shear diagrams based on my bridge claculation)
- I want to figure out why the program was unable to save to a text file.
- I want to add a user interface, making this calculator into a web app.
